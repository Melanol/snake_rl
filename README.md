# snake_rl
A clone of the classic Snake game with few modifications intended to ease the use in RL. The field size can be changed. An RL agent will be able to easily differentiate what is moving and where. The first apple spawns close to the head.

Use WASD or ARROWS for navigation. Use SPACE to start the game or to pause it.

Tested in Kubuntu 18.04.
